              I will stay committed to pass every test in school so I can get a
              great career thanks to the mentoring I have received from Mr.
              Edward. I have learnt the most about discipline and commitment
              from him. His passion for web development is an inspiration to me
              and all his other mentees.

              It is usually students who learn from teachers but I have also
              learnt from Mr. Edward. I wondered how he always made the time for
              the classes which I later learnt is a product of his commitment
              and dedication to improve his life and his family. He was always a
              step ahead of class, oozing interest and curiosity about design
              and coding. Excellent!

              I am yet to meet an individual with a generous heart as my husband
              Edward. He has such a giving spirit. I remember one evening he had
              an exam for his masterâ€™s class after a long day at work, but
              decided to help out a mentee student who was behind on his project
              before jumped right into his exam afterwards. Few individuals give
              back to the community with such generosity nowadays

              I had little idea where to start with coding until I met my
              mentor, Mr Edward. He made it so easy for me to get settled in
              with coding faster than I thought I would. He encouraged me and
              helped me out when I was stuck. He is my inspiration.

              Ed made me a website that works like a charm. I enjoy the ease of
              the UI and I highly recommend his web design skills to anyone in
              need of a website. My web visitors have commented on the color
              code and they love it especially. Great job Pal!
